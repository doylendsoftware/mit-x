# mit-x
An alternative to the MIT License, extended with patent protection clauses.

The MIT License is a great license for software. Unlike the GPL, it is not viral, and it does not impose the inconvenient restrictions that the LPGL does on source distribution.

However, the MIT License lacks clauses protecting the creator of the software from patent trolls. This license is an alternative, which adds the necessary clauses to the MIT License.

This license was not created by a lawyer. Any feedback on legal loopholes is very much appreaciated.
